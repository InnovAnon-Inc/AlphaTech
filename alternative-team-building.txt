instead of "getting acquainted" and what not,
just put everybody in a room for a while...
probably 15-30 minutes.

and just sit there quietly.

...

when somebody says something,
say, please don't speak.

if asked questions,
only reply with,
"this is a team building excersize."

and then make everybody work quietly
and rapidly on a contrived problem
with a short deadline.
maybe for a few days
