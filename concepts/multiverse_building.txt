Multiverse Building

Each "world" is a complete 4D or 5D universe, often with varying parameters. There are parallel universes. These parallel universes co-exist within the same "dimension" or "level." There are at least seven levels above the 3D projection of the multiverse for a total of at least 10D.

The experiential aspect of existence, the "soul," has an inherent XP or power-level. A soul's power-level directly corresponds to the number of dimensions of reality it can be aware of and experience (being able to experience something precedes being able to willfully act upon it). In this sense, doing research in multidimensional non-euclidean geometry is basically power-grinding.

Souls are bound to a particular object, person or place in a dimension, but can rebind to a new object given sufficient knowledge/ability. At death, a lot of souls tend to rebind to a new life in that same dimension.

In higher-level dimensions, things which are abstract in lower dimensions become concrete. In the low dimensions, concepts are intangible. In the higher dimensions, these things have "physical" forms. Each noun and verb, representing concepts, would therefore embody souls. It follows that nouns and verbs have tangible existences in the higher dimensions.
