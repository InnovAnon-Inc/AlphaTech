Each "series" will be focused around a particular soul, the "protagonist."

Here is one such series:
The protagonist is super-powerful, but there's some sort of deus ex machina that limits his power to make him super-weak. and at the end of every season, the deus ex machina takes a break for a few minutes--usually during an eclipse or something--and the protagonist gets super strong. the protagonist is like... some sort of god.
as we know, a person's nen-aura becomes much stronger at death. but it also becomes angry.

So, people use the Hindu death rites to banish the deceased's soul to the heavens, so he can't become a powerful, angry spirit.

Well, I mean, he does become a powerful, angry spirit, but just not in this dimension.

Here's where the dimensional travel gets a little tricky. so the dead dude will go to a certain "level" of dimension based on his life's path.

But, if he becomes a powerful angry spirit in this dimension, then he can ultimately fizzle into non-existence or "move on." in this sense, "move on," means to go to the aforementioned level + 1. that is, one level higher, because of the power boost.

Now, if the Hindu death rites are applied, that will add yet another level to the deceased's ascent.

So a normal dead dude can stay on this level or go to a certain level based on his soul-level. let k denote that level.

If he dies angry, getting the nen-boost.... or if the death rites are applied... then he'll go to level k + 1.

If he dies angry, gets the nen-boost and the death rites are applied, then he'll go to level k + 2.

So the multi-dimensional hierarchy is basically some sort of tournament structure or something. In the series, we can explore the shocking implications of such a cosmology.
