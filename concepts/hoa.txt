An interrelated series:
There's a trans-dimensional "cult:" Beings of one dimension serve Beings of the next (i.e., one mortal's god is another god's mortal), which in turn accelerate Their mortals/servants' ascension to the next dimension.

The metaphysics of the multi-dimensional cosmos is such that this bootstrapping-process creates some sort of momentum that accelerates the ascension of the gods, thus providing a motive for higher-dimensional beings to be symbiotic-enough with lower-dimensional beings to cultivate a following.

This trans-dimensional cult has an expansive body of "holy" texts. The twist is that they know the texts are fictional (as it turns out, presenting something as fiction bypasses the critical filter in the brain). I suppose that, during the Kali Yuga, the Gospel Truth is less convincing than the Gospel Fiction.

Naturally, they ascribe some sort of esoteric significance to that their holy book is fictional. Like... the path to attaining gnosis of their patron lovecraftian horror(s) is that it never gets explained in a direct, logical form. It has to be understood indirectly, through the various myths and fables contained in the ever-expanding body of holy texts.

Of course, the lovecraftian horrors occasionally appear in a directly ascertainable way (i.e., they appear on Earth and wreak havoc) in order to add story-generating fuel to his followers' dumpster fire of a biblical saga.

Hey, maybe the appearance of the lovecraftian horrors will more-or-less correspond to the other protagonist's power-boost.
