Fractal Multiverse

A multiverse is layered like an onion and shaped like an extra-dimensional ball.

In a multiverse with positive curvature, a universe is on the inside of the multiverse's surface. Higher dimensions are inner layers of the multi-dimensional figure. At the highest dimension, the center of the shape, there is a singularity.

On the other side of the singularity is a multiverse with negative curvature. In such a multiverse, a universe is on the outside of the multi-dimension's surface. Higher dimensions are outer layers of the multi-dimensional figure. The aforementioned singularity-portal lies at the lowest dimension, the center of the shape.

That is, the totality of a multiverse consists of a positive side, a negative mirror side and a singularity. It would be easiest to travel from one level to the next or one level to the previous or (maybe) one level to its mirror-level.

These multiverse-bubbles exist within a multi-multiverse structure. Perhaps these multiverse-bubbles have solar systems, orbits, etc, forming a sort of fractal-like symmetry with our 3D reality.
