# AlphaTech
Beyond bleeding-edge technologies implemented in semi-coherent mumbles and rants
----------
CInetD
- pronounced "See Net Dee"
- InetD-like server
- choice of EZIO/ThrIO/ThrEV backend
- invokes cb funcs

SeaShell
- because CSH is already a thing,
  and ironically has very little to do with C
- easy multi-threaded
  (not multi-process)
  stream-oriented C coding

YellShell
- speech-to-text frontend to a shell
- idk... maybe it decreases the niceness of your spawned processes
  if you actually yell at it

Simon v3
- "Simon, the Drawer-er"
- "mockup framework"
- instantiates random Objects,
  instead of Random objects
- generates "realistic" test data
  for when actual test data is classified
  or otherwise inaccessible to devs
- v2 could occassionally generate "convincing" artwork
- v1 generated random (subtypes) of Objects
- v0 generated random Java programs

HoGrai
- pronounced "Hoe Grey"
- Ho(ly) Grai(l)
- uses Simon backend
- minimax(?) search with iterative deepening
- generates random code

Finux (Heterogeneous Multi-)Cluster v2
- pronounced "Phoenix Cluster"
- rambooting + PXE booting cluster
- uses in-house software repository
- rebuilds packages and reverse-deps
  when updates are available upstream,
  allowing the species to "auto-evolve"
- compiles software with PGO,
  allowing the "hive" to "auto-adapt"
- "user" data is stored on disk,
  system data is volatile and only in memory
- v1 used FreeBSD, never completed
- v0 used debootstrap and no PXE

NoOSSh
- pronounced like a cross between "whoosh" and "noose"
- No OS Sh(ell)
- UEFI-level shell
- SCM interpreter/compiler
- using PELCR backend
- and goedelize-able syntax

g-hOSt
- pronounced "ghost"
- g, the successor to F (i.e., the Finux Cluster)
- "host" OS
- micro-exo-kernel
- possibly implemented in an exotic language

MMORPG
- pronounced "Morp Jee" ?
- encourages bots
  like RoboCode
- all uploaded code gets branded with InnovAnon-Inc license
- interactive environment (i.e., everything can be destroyed)
- realistic physics
- bot code should be easily port-able to quadracopters or something
- automatically generated maps, music, quests, etc:
  - see Simon

HC ?
- "hardware compiler"
- designs circuits to run the specified app(s)
- option to build circuits from "salvaged" parts

PLibC
- "Pleb See"
- parallel libc
- MPI + OpenCL + pthreads

Function generator
- given definition of input and expected output,
  generate a function which satisfies the constraints

Parameter optimizer
- given a function and definitions of its inputs,
  and a way to compare which results are more "optimal,"
  find values for the parameters which produce the most "optimal" result

Personal Terminator
- "physical" security and virus removal
- also a bug zapper
- mobility-enabled (i.e., flying or rolling) or wearable
- integrates with YellShell and SeaShell
