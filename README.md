# AlphaTech
Beyond bleeding-edge technologies implemented in semi-coherent mumbles and rants--too bleeding-edge to actually exist.
==========
CInetD
- pronounced "See Net Dee"
- InetD-like server
- choice of EZIO/ThrIO/ThrEV backend
- invokes cb funcs
----------
SeaShell
- because CSH is already a thing,
  and ironically has very little to do with C
- easy multi-threaded
  (not multi-process)
  stream-oriented C coding
- dlopen() and dlclose()
- integrate with GRELs for a good time ;)
----------
YellShell
- speech-to-text frontend to a shell
- idk... maybe it decreases the niceness of your spawned processes
  if you actually yell at it
----------
Simon v3
- "Simon, the Drawer-er"
- "mockup framework"
- instantiates random Objects,
  instead of Random objects
- generates "realistic" test data
  for when actual test data is classified
  or otherwise inaccessible to devs
- v2 could occassionally generate "convincing" artwork
- v1 generated random (subtypes) of Objects
- v0 generated random Java programs
----------
HoGrai
- pronounced "Hoe Grey"
- Ho(ly) Grai(l)
- uses Simon backend
- minimax(?) search with iterative deepening
- generates random code
----------
Finux (Heterogeneous Multi-)Cluster v2
- pronounced "Phoenix Cluster"
- rambooting + PXE booting cluster
- uses in-house software repository
- rebuilds packages and reverse-deps
  when updates are available upstream,
  allowing the species to "auto-evolve"
- compiles software with PGO,
  allowing the "hive" to "auto-adapt"
- "user" data is stored on disk,
  system data is volatile and only in memory
- v1 used FreeBSD, never completed
- v0 used debootstrap and no PXE
----------
NoOSSh
- pronounced like a cross between "whoosh" and "noose"
- No OS Sh(ell)
- UEFI-level shell
- SCM interpreter/compiler
- using PELCR backend
- and goedelize-able syntax
----------
g-hOSt
- pronounced "ghost"
- g, the successor to F (i.e., the Finux Cluster)
- "host" OS
- micro-exo-kernel
- possibly implemented in an exotic language
----------
MMORPG
- pronounced "Morp Jee" ?
- encourages bots
  like RoboCode
- all uploaded code gets branded with InnovAnon-Inc license
- interactive environment (i.e., everything can be destroyed)
- realistic physics
- bot code should be easily port-able to quadracopters or something
- automatically generated maps, music, quests, etc:
  - see Simon
----------
HC ?
- "hardware compiler"
- designs circuits to run the specified app(s)
- option to build circuits from "salvaged" parts
----------
PLibC
- "Pleb See"
- parallel libc
- MPI + OpenCL + pthreads
----------
Function generator
- given definition of input and expected output,
  generate a function which satisfies the constraints
----------
Parameter optimizer
- given a function and definitions of its inputs,
  and a way to compare which results are more "optimal,"
  find values for the parameters which produce the most "optimal" result
----------
Personal Terminator
- "physical" security and virus removal
- also a bug zapper
- mobility-enabled (i.e., flying or rolling) or wearable
- integrates with YellShell and SeaShell
----------
MPFP
- massively parallel functional primitives
- map, reduce, accumulate, filter
- MPICC + pthreads + OpenCL + libev?
----------
The Game
- randomly generated
- fully immersive, augmented reality, virtual reality
- generated artwork and soundtrack
- generated storylines
- personality profiling
- targeted advertising and product placement:
  - identify user's interest and shopping needs
  - generate map and storyline with opportunities for relevant product placement
- game should be an AI with a fitness function which optimizes ad revenue by keeping users online and engaged
----------
Ad Validator
- integrate selenium or something with web page to validate that all the ads are properly loaded and visible and not muted
----------
JuToob
- host content on p2p network
- main web page has to host torrent links and maybe screenshots and other metadata
- free and unmoderated
----------
PorkerNet
- IP over HAM
- FOSS hardware (e.g., raspberry pi or gumstix)
- need to bridge to the real internet
- - business model: charge users to use your bridge
----------
TerminatorVision
- use a HUD, like eye-lense wearable computer
- be able to show measurements, angles, estimated density and weight, velocity, acceleration, estimated stopping time, etc, of the environment and objects in the environment
- be able to scan the faces of passersby, do OSINT search and display info about the people
- uses similar technology as self-driving cars to show optimal paths when walking
- can apply arbitrary filters and effects to specific objects in the environment. e.g., always apply camera effects to your boss's face
- can be networked together so each person can see similar effects applied to objects in their environment, creating a shared experience in this virtual reality
----------
FortunateCookie
- Creates entries for the Fortune database
- Gathers statistics from various things, build models to predict events, then creates entries in the fortune database, so that your terminal fortunes will predict your day.
----------
RoboBand
- each member has a programmable robot that can generate musical concepts, do contrapuntal accompanyment and compute transformations
- the robots are networked together and can share data while generating music
----------
social media client that would extend the functionality of buffer/hootsuite. Except it would host your meta-profile (locally and also on github/bitbucket)... one profile which would be mirrored on each site.
----------
Project Moom: Dream Doom Server to play coop with Mom
modify Oblige/ObAddon to replicate the trippy features of the map Impossible! A New Reality
get Colorful Hell, LegenDoom, FractalDoom, Project Brutality and Rainbow Blood to play nicely together
probably also switch out Doom monsters for SS guards to make it more reminiscent of '94, when we'd play Wolf3d together
generate a fresh Hell everyday
